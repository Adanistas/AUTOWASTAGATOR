### ⚡ Problem Statement: Design and develop a model to differentiate between dry, wet & plastic waste automatically while throwing a dust in dustbin </i>

## PROJECT EXPLANATION
✨ The current system of waste management requires every individual to sort out the waste into dry, wet or plastic by their own discretion. This system works till the individual has some deadline to catch, or is just simply too lazy.

✨  But the environment worsens and the waste management workers have to work more, or it can also be said, suffer more because of this indifference of individuals to waste segregation. 

✨ In India, 77% of waste is disposed of in open dumps,18% is composted and just 5% is recycled. This improper disposal of waste has led to generation of huge amounts of CO2. 

✨ Large organizations like companies, schools, stores, restaurants and other commercial and institutional buildings generate significant amounts of materials and waste. In these organizations, it is a very challenging job to ensure all the individuals follow the waste segregation methods. So, these large organizations are the main target for our solution.

✨The proposed solution is an Automatic Waste Segregator,” The Autowastagator”.

        💮The Automatic Waste Segregator will be built using an Image Classification model using the ResNet50 algorithm. The model will be built on a Waste Images Dataset procured from different resources in order to increase the accuracy and efficiency of the model.
        
        💮The data collected from various sources are resized .The dataset is then trained and tested and a model is created. The input to the model will be a video input where the video comprises of trash being thrown.

        💮Video is split into frames(1 image for every 7s of video). Predication made on frames
        
        💮 As already mentioned as the target audience will be members of an organization, there is a high probability only one trash is thrown at a time which is then recorded by a webcam and then the waste category classification is done.
        
        💮 At the end of the process a report is generated comprising of the details of the number of images (obtained from video stream) of each category of waste disposed.

✨  <b>The waste report</b> generated in this proposed system, provides essential information related to the trash disposed. This information can be utilized to take necessary steps to dispose / recycle these wastes using correct methodologies.
